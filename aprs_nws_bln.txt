# This document contains the proposed APRS-NWS bulletin format for a weather alert.
# NOTE:  The bulletin identifier does not comply with APRS v1.01 specification for an NWS Bulletin due to not having a hyphen('-') in the 4th position of the identifier.
#        This was a deliberate change to permit implementing the official NWS state/zone designation in the bulletin identifier as many user radios have the ability to filter bulletins by identifiers, including wildcard characters.
         This change allows users easily to set specific identifiers of interest into their radio filters.

# As noted in the APRS v1.01 specification, the message identifier at the end of this bulletin is for reference only.
